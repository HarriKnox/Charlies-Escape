This game was built by all six of us in our game design course at university. Using the  [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org/door) platform we designed all the code in all the objects to make a functional game. Every member was given a different task (such as level design, animation, entity actions, etc.). Comments marking the author's name follow various sections in the code.

### Built with [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org/door)
You'll need to download the Greenfoot program to compile the game, but the provided `CharliesEscape.jar` is an executable jar that also plays the game.

### Running
To run the game do one of the following:
1. Run Greenfoot, open the scenario, compile, play
2. Execute `java -jar CharliesEscape.jar` in the game folder

### Gameplay
The controls are simple:
- `left` and `right` arrow keys move horizontally
- `up` jumps
- `space` shoots (when you have a gun and ammo)

Avoid the Viet Cong and various traps and escape the Vietnamese jungle.
